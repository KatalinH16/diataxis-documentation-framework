Development of Di치taxis
=======================

Di치taxis was created and developed by Daniele Procida at `Divio <https://divio.com>`_.

Divio's `developer documentation <https://docs.divio.com>`_ for its cloud management/ application deployment
platform is a high-quality example of a complete Di치taxis implementation.

The Di치taxis framework continues to be developed and refined.
