The first concerns the horizontal axis: does (or should) this documentation

If it's concerned with practical steps, then you know that you're dealing with
tutorial or how-to material. If it's concerned with theoretical information, then you know that you're dealing with reference or explanation.

Now you can consider whether it's something that someone who is
