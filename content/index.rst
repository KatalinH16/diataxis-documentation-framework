Diátaxis Framework
========================================================

..  rubric:: A systematic framework for technical documentation authoring.

The Diátaxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation. It adopts a systematic
approach to understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of interaction with a product.

Four modes of documentation
----------------------------

..  sidebar:: *Diátaxis*

    From the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς - *dia*, "across", and *taxis*, "arrangement".

The framework identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**, **how-to guides**, **technical reference** and
**explanation**.

Each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfils a different purpose and requires a different
approach to its creation.

Technical documentation should be structured explicitly around these four types, and should keep them all separate and
distinct from each other.

In other words, what we call *documentation* is fundamentally not one thing, but four. Understanding the implications
of this, and how those four different things work, can help improve most documentation.

Diátaxis promises to make documentation and projects better, and the teams that work with them more successful.

..  rst-class:: quote

    While redesigning the `Cloudflare developer docs <https://developers.cloudflare.com>`_, this content framework
    became our north star for information architecture. When we weren’t sure where a new piece of content should fit
    in, we’d consult the framework. Our documentation is now clearer than it’s ever been, both for readers and
    contributors.

====================

Light-weight and easily adopted
-----------------------------------

The framework is light-weight, easy to understand and straightforward to apply. It doesn't impose implementation
constraints.

Complete and comprehensive
----------------------------

Diátaxis provides a comprehensive and nearly universally-applicable scheme, that has been :ref:`proven in practice
across a wide variety of fields and applications <adoption>`. These include large and small, and open and proprietary
documentation projects.

Here is a video of a conference talk presenting the concepts encapsulated in Diátaxis, from PyCon Australia 2017.
